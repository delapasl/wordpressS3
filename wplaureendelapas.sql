In fact, he\'s accidentally lent it out to graduate student Chris Parsons, who soon realizes that this is an extraordinary text indeed. The book is also sought by the evil scientist Skagra, who has developed a sphere capable of drawing its victims\' minds out of their bodies. Skagra needs the book to reach the Time Lord prison Shada, which even the Time Lords have forgotten. Long ago they imprisoned the criminal Salyavin there, as punishment for using his powers to transfer his mind into other people\'s bodies. Chronotis is eventually forced to admit that he himself is Salyavin; he escaped long ago and used his powers to cause the Time Lords to forget about his prison. However, he\'s now repented of his crimes and wishes to live a quiet, peaceful life. Skagra drains Chronotis\'s mind and thus acquires the ability to transfer his own mind into other bodies; with the aid of the sphere and his crystalline servants, the Krargs, he will spread his own mind throughout the Universe and become immortal. However, when the Doctor pretends to be stupid, the sphere fails to drain his mind completely. He thus survives, and since there\'s a copy of his mind inside the sphere, he is able to use the resonance to turn Skagra\'s possessed slaves against him. Skagra is imprisoned by his own Ship, and Chronotis returns to Earth to resume his peaceful retirement.</p>', 21, 17, '0000-00-00', NULL, 'http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/323325/doctor-who-17x21-shada-part-one'),

multi-instrumentaliste de jazz Rahsaan Roland Kirk, la dernière version de WordPress est disponible en téléchargement.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-1493\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

nouveau bloc, des interactions plus intuitives et une accessibilité améliorée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les nouvelles fonctionnalités de l’éditeur augmentent la liberté de conception, fournissent des options de mise en page supplémentaires et des variations de styles permettant aux concepteurs de contrôler totalement l’apparence de leur site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version introduit également le thème Twenty Twenty, offrant à l’utilisateur plus de flexibilité de conception et d’intégration avec l&rsquo;éditeur. Créer de belles pages web et des mises en page avancées n’a jamais été aussi simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Des améliorations de l’éditeur de blocs et de l&rsquo;ergonomie du back- office</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls muted src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2019/11/navigation.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette mise à jour focalisée sur les améliorations introduit plus de 150 nouvelles fonctionnalités et améliorations d’utilisabilité, comme la prise en charge des grandes images pour téléverser les images de haute résolution prises avec votre téléphone ou avec d’autre appareils de haute résolution. En combinaison avec l’utilisation de tailles d’images plus larges, vos photos seront le mieux traitées possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les améliorations d’accessibilité incluent l’intégration des styles de l’éditeur dans l’interface d’administration. Ces améliorations corrigent de nombreux problèmes d’accessibilité&nbsp;: contrastes des couleurs sur les champs de formulaires et sur les boutons, cohérence entre l’éditeur et les écrans d’administration, nouvelles notices affichées à la volée, standardisation du jeu de couleurs par défaut de WordPress, et l’introduction d’animations pour rendre l’interaction avec les blocs plus élégante et naturelle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour les personnes utilisant un clavier pour naviguer sur l’administration, l’éditeur dispose maintenant d’un mode de navigation. Cela permet de sauter d’un bloc à l’autre sans tabuler à travers l’ensemble des éléments de chaque bloc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Une flexibilité de conception étendue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 ajoute des outils toujours plus robustes pour concevoir de beaux sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le nouveau bloc Groupe vous permet de diviser facilement votre page en sections colorées</li><li>Le bloc des colonnes prend maintenant en charge les largeurs fixes de colonnes</li><li>Les nouvelles mises en page prédéfinies transforment en jeu d&rsquo;enfant l’organisation du contenu dans des conceptions avancées</li><li>Le bloc Titre dispose maintenant d’un sélecteur de couleur de texte</li><li>Des options de style supplémentaires vous permettent de définir votre style préféré pour n&rsquo;importe quel bloc qui prend en charge cette fonctionnalité</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arrivée de Twenty Twenty</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-desktop-300x297.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-medium\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile-267x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile-267x300.png 267w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/twentytwenty-mobile.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Le nouvel éditeur fêtant son premier anniversaire, il est appréciable que l’idée directrice de Twenty Twenty soit la flexibilité. Montrez vos services ou vos produits avec des combinaisons de colonnes, de groupes et de blocs médias. Mettez en place vos contenus en grande ou même pleine largeur pour des mises en page dynamiques et attirantes… ou laissez vos réflexions prendre toute la place avec une simple colonne de contenu centrée&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce thème nommé «&nbsp;Twenty Twenty&nbsp;» le mérite bien&nbsp;: la clarté et la lisibilité sont aussi de grandes priorités. Le thème inclut la police&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rsms.me/inter/\">Inter</a>, conçue par Rasmus Andersson. «&nbsp;Inter&nbsp;» est implémentée sous la forme d’une police variable, une première pour un thème par défaut. Cela améliore les temps de chargement car cette police contient toutes les tailles et toutes les variations de styles en seulement deux fichiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improvements for Everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rotation automatique des images</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-thumbnail is-resized\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Rotate.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Vos images seront correctement orientées lors du téléversement en fonction des données d’orientation embarquées dans le fichier. Cette fonctionnalité a été proposée pour la première fois il y a neuf ans, et son implémentation a été rendue possible grâce à la persévérance de plusieurs contributrices et contributeurs passionné·e·s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vérifications de l’état de santé du site</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-thumbnail is-resized\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1507\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Health.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Les améliorations introduites dans 5.3 rendent encore plus facile l’identification des problèmes. Les recommandations qui nécessiteraient un dépannage sont mises en avant sur l’écran «&nbsp;Santé de votre site&nbsp;».</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vérification de l’e-mail d’administration</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-thumbnail is-resized\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1508\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email-150x150.png 150w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/Email.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous sera dorénavant périodiquement demandé de confirmer que votre adresse de messagerie est à jour quand vous vous connectez en tant qu’administrateur. Cela réduit le risque de verrouillage sans pouvoir accéder à votre site si vous changez d’adresse de messagerie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pour les développeuses et les développeurs</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Correctifs sur le composant date/heure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les développeurs et développeuses peuvent maintenant mieux travailler avec les&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/23/date-time-improvements-wp-5-3/\">dates et fuseaux horaires</a>. La fonctionnalité de gestion de la date et de l’heure a reçue quantité de nouvelles fonctions API pour unifier l’utilisation des fuseaux horaires, pour améliorer l’intéropérabilité PHP ainsi que plusieurs correctifs et améliorations diverses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compatibilité PHP 7.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 vise à prendre en charge totalement PHP 7.4. Cette version contient de&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/11/wordpress-and-php-7-4/\">multiples modifications</a>&nbsp;pour retirer les fonctionnalités dépréciées et assurer la compatibilité. WordPress continue d’encourager ses utilisatrices et utilisateurs à faire tourner leurs sites sur la dernière et la meilleure version de PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous cherchez des informations plus techniques sur les évolutions de WordPress 5.3, n&rsquo;oubliez pas de <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/2019/10/24/les-changements-a-venir-dans-wordpress-5-3/\">consulter notre article dédié</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1497\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/11/divider-300x76.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>L&rsquo;équipe derrière WP 5.3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette version de WordPress a été coordonnée par <a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/francina\">Francesca Marano</a> et&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dream-encode.com/blog/\">David Baumwald</a>.

Elles sont simples à identifier puisqu&rsquo;elles utilisent le domaine <code>WordPress.org</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deux types de sources officielles co-existent actuellement dans les résultats de recherche : l&rsquo;ancien <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/\">Codex</a>, et <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org\">DevHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le codex c&rsquo;est terminé, place à DevHub&nbsp;!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depuis maintenant quelques années, une migration a été lancée vers la nouvelle plateforme de référence pour la documentation de WordPress&nbsp;: surnommée «&nbsp;DevHub&nbsp;», <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org\">developer.wordpress.org</a> a pour vocation de remplacer totalement l&rsquo;ancien Codex.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pourquoi changer&nbsp;?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basé sur un Wiki (une encyclopédie modifiable), le Codex avait l&rsquo;avantage (et l&rsquo;inconvénient) d&rsquo;avoir un contenu intégralement généré par ses utilisatrices et utilisateurs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avantages, car il n&rsquo;y avait pas de limite à la création de pages de documentation et cela permettait à tout un chacun de proposer des contributions, des exemples, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inconvénients, car il était alors quasiment impossible de maintenir à jour cette documentation. Les fonctionnalités de WordPress évoluent rapidement, au rythme de généralement 3 nouvelles versions majeures par an et une dizaine de versions mineures. Il est très difficile de tenir la documentation de ces fonctionnalités à jour avec quelques dizaines de volontaires. Ainsi, le Codex est condamné à une certaine obsolescence, le volume de contribution des nouvelles pages de documentation ne pouvant suivre le volume d&rsquo;évolutions au sein du CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DevHub, vers une documentation semi-automatisée</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Au contraire du Codex, la nouvelle plateforme de référence DevHub – <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org\">developer.wordpress.org</a> – fonctionne de façon automatisée (ou presque).</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#04598a;color:#ffffff\" class=\"has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size\">Sur DevHub, la documentation des fonctions, crochets (hooks), filtres et autres actions est générée automatiquement à partir de la documentation présente dans les fichiers du cœur du CMS.<br><strong>Cette documentation est donc toujours 100% à jour par rapport au cœur WP.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour le coup, l&rsquo;avantage est clair&nbsp;: <strong>dès la sortie d&rsquo;une nouvelle version de WordPress, l&rsquo;ensemble de la documentation est automatiquement mis à jour</strong> pour intégrer les nouvelles fonctionnalités, comprenant les pages de documentation existantes comme la création de nouvelles pages pour les nouvelles fonctionnalités.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;inconvénient que l&rsquo;on peut y voir est un format plus rigide que l&rsquo;ancien Codex. Même si cela a clairement des avantages en terme de rapidité de l&rsquo;accès à l&rsquo;information vu que tout est formaté de la même façon, cela aura peut-être pour certain·e·s un peu moins de charme que le bon vieux Codex et ses pages générées à l&rsquo;huile de coude <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Le codex progressivement redirigé vers DevHub</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Les pages du Codex seront progressivement redirigées de façon permanente vers DevHub (c&rsquo;est déjà le cas pour beaucoup d&rsquo;entre elles). D&rsquo;ici là, faites attention :</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"background-color:#04598a;color:#ffffff\" class=\"has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Les contenus du Codex ne sont plus maintenus</strong> et proposent donc une documentation incomplète ou obsolète. <br>Il est fortement recommandé d&rsquo;utiliser la documentation proposée sur developer.wordpress.org <strong>qui est maintenant la seule documentation officielle de WordPress à jour</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien sûr, les pages du Codex étant progressivement redirigées vers DevHub, nous sommes dans une période de transition pendant laquelle les deux co-existent. Forts d&rsquo;une grande notoriété, les pages du Codex apparaissent souvent avant les pages DevHub dans les résultats de recherche. Mais cela sera résolu au fur et à mesure de la redirection permanente des pages vers DevHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub.png\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-1024x406.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1432\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-1024x406.png 1024w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-300x119.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub-768x304.png 768w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/codex-devhub.png 1120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment lire une page de documentation sur DevHub</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prenons par exemple une fonction de base de WP au hasard&nbsp;:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_time/\"><code>get_the_time()</code></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sur la fiche developer.w.org, on retrouvera plusieurs sections :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le&nbsp;<strong>nom</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction</li><li>Une&nbsp;<strong>description courte</strong></li><li>Une&nbsp;<strong>description longue</strong>&nbsp;(quand c&rsquo;est nécessaire)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1433\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1.png 737w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-1-300x50.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Les&nbsp;<strong>paramètres d’entrée</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction :</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1434\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2.png 710w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-2-300x116.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Les éléments&nbsp;<strong>retournés</strong>&nbsp;par la fonction (si la fonction est sensée retourner quelque chose) :</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1435\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3.png 782w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3-300x47.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-3-768x120.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>La&nbsp;<strong>source</strong>&nbsp;de la fonction dans le cœur WordPress, avec les éléments suivants :<ul><li>Le fichier dans lequel la fonction est déclarée (lien cliquable vers la liste de toutes les fonctions déclarées dans ce fichier).</li><li>Le code de la fonction.</li><li>Un bouton permettant de voir le code source en entier.</li><li>Un lien «&nbsp;View on Trac&nbsp;» pour voir la fonction au sein du fichier où elle est déclarée sur Trac, sur le dépôt du code source de WordPress.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png\"><img src=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1436\" srcset=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4.png 989w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4-300x113.png 300w, https://fr.wordpress.org/files/2019/09/devhub-4-768x289.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Le&nbsp;<strong>changelog</strong>&nbsp;: il s’agit de la liste des différentes modifications faites sur la fonction et de la version de WordPress correspondant à chaque modification.

Si c&rsquo;est le cas, nous vous préconisons de remplacer ces sélecteurs par, respectivement :</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><code>#primary</code></li><li><code>.content-area</code></li><li><code>.site-main</code></li><li><code>#main</code></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour plus d&rsquo;informations, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47066\">voici le ticket Trac du Cœur WordPress correspondant à ce correctif</a> ainsi que la version originale de cet article, en anglais&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EzwQ2qrlqW\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/04/changes-on-twenty-nineteen-html-structure-in-wordpress-5-3/\">Changes on Twenty Nineteen HTML structure in WordPress 5.3</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Changes on Twenty Nineteen HTML structure in WordPress 5.3&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/04/changes-on-twenty-nineteen-html-structure-in-wordpress-5-3/embed/#?secret=EzwQ2qrlqW\" data-secret=\"EzwQ2qrlqW\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>En cas de doute, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à publier un commentaire sous cet article (il sera mis en attente de validation par l&rsquo;un des responsables de ce site, donc patientez quelques heures…) ou à utiliser le <a href=\"https://wpfr.net/support\">forum d&rsquo;entraide de WPFR</a> ou encore le <a href=\"https://wpfr.net/slack\">Slack WordPress-FR (demander une invitation gratuite ici)</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://fr.wordpress.org/2019/09/05/wordpress-5-3-et-twenty-nineteen-verifiez-vos-css/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n				\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n							\n		\n							\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Découvrez les nouveautés de WordPress 5.2 «Jaco»\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://fr.wordpress.org/2019/05/02/decouvrez-les-nouveautes-de-wordpress-5-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://fr.wordpress.org/2019/05/02/decouvrez-les-nouveautes-de-wordpress-5-2/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 May 2019 07:18:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Nouvelles versions de WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://fr.wordpress.org/?p=1355\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:448:\"Nommée « Jaco » en l&#8217;honneur du bassiste de jazz Jaco Pastorius, la version 5.2 de WordPress est sortie le 7 mai 2019.

Si cela se passe en votre absence (via une mise à jour automatique par exemple) alors vous recevrez un e-mail contenant des informations sur le bug rencontré et sur le fait que votre site est passé en <em>mode de récupération</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus, vous pouvez consulter cet article (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"g5hchqhLg4\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">Fatal Error Recovery Mode in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Fatal Error Recovery Mode in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=g5hchqhLg4\" data-secret=\"g5hchqhLg4\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arrêt de la prise en charge des versions de PHP obsolètes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>À partir de WordPress 5.2, le CMS ne sera plus compatible avec les versions de PHP inférieures à 5.6.20.

Si vous êtes dans ce cas là, rapprochez-vous de votre hébergeur afin de passer sur une version de PHP plus récente.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Éditeur / Gutenberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>De nombreuses améliorations ont été faites dans l&rsquo;éditeur. En dehors des optimisations de performances et d&rsquo;utilisabilité, citons notamment l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un module <code>block-editor</code> réutilisable pour permettre l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;éditeur de façon indépendante de l&rsquo;éditeur de publications, sans dépendance vis à vis des publications. Cela permettra de pouvoir l&rsquo;utiliser dans d&rsquo;autres écrans de l&rsquo;administration WordPress, comme par exemple dans l&rsquo;écran <em>Widgets</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus, vous pouvez consulter cet article (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Z65XzE2Jdn\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">The Block Editor JavaScript module in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;The Block Editor JavaScript module in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=Z65XzE2Jdn\" data-secret=\"Z65XzE2Jdn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessibilité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Une amélioration du balisage des onglets utilisés dans l&rsquo;administration WordPress a été intégrée, ainsi que du balisage des formats d’articles, de la barre d’administration, et le Widget de sélection d&rsquo;archives d&rsquo;articles a maintenant un meilleur fonctionnement sur les technologies d&rsquo;assistance telles que les lecteurs d&rsquo;écrans/synthèses vocales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour en savoir plus sur ces changements (en anglais) : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NhV3S5uMlh\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">Admin Tabs Semantic Improvements in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Admin Tabs Semantic Improvements in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=NhV3S5uMlh\" data-secret=\"NhV3S5uMlh\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"M74Sdl656H\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">Notable Accessibility Changes in 5.2</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Notable Accessibility Changes in 5.2&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/embed/#?secret=M74Sdl656H\" data-secret=\"M74Sdl656H\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confidentialité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le composant <em>Privacy</em> (confidentialité) du cœur WordPress a été amélioré avec l&rsquo;ajout de 4 nouvelles fonctionnalités pour rendre la personnalisation et le design de la page de politique de confidentialité plus simple.

Développée par Ella van Durpe et utilisée pour la première fois par Matt Mullenweg il y a quelques semaines au WordCamp US 2019, l&rsquo;idée, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;elle permet de construire l&rsquo;ensemble de sa présentation en utilisant directement l&rsquo;éditeur Gutenberg&nbsp;!<br>Parfait pour mon sujet du jour <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" /></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yQRvnG7akj\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/slide/\">Slides &amp; Presentations</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3a5.png\" alt=\"🎥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" /> Les slides de ma présentation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Les slides de la présentation, fièrement propulsées par Gutenberg&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Note&nbsp;: si vous souhaitez insérer cette visionneuse de slides de ma conférence sur votre site, copiez-collez le code suivant&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code alignwide\"><code class=\"language-markup\">&lt;iframe src=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/presentation/presentation/wordcamp-marseille-2019/#/\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;border:20px solid #d7cfab;\" class=\"alignwide\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" /> Synthèse de la conférence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour celles et ceux qui n&rsquo;étaient pas là ou qui étaient en train de voir l&rsquo;excellente conférence de Frédérique Battel dans la salle d&rsquo;à côté, voici une <s>petite</s> synthèse.

Qu&rsquo;ont-ils de si spécial&nbsp;?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah ça ! Les blocs réutilisables et moi c&rsquo;est une grande histoire d&rsquo;amour&nbsp;! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f496.png\" alt=\"💖\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;max-height: 1em\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée du bloc réutilisable, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ajouter au sein de l&rsquo;éditeur la possibilité d&rsquo;enregistrer un bloc – ou un ensemble de blocs – pour pouvoir le réutiliser en dehors du contexte dans lequel il a été construit. Une fois enregistré, on le retrouve dans l&rsquo;outil d&rsquo;insertion soit en allant dans la section «&nbsp;blocs réutilisables&nbsp;», soit en le recherchant par le nom que vous lui avez donné.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les principes-clés&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blocs-reutilisables-menu.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34013\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Simplicité&nbsp;: une interface claire et accessible quel que soit votre niveau technique</li><li>Universalité&nbsp;: les blocs de contenus sont réutilisables de partout sur le site de façon transversale</li><li>Synchronisation&nbsp;: le contenu de chaque bloc réutilisable est synchronisé, donc si je le modifie à un endroit, le contenu sera mis à jour de partout</li><li>Désynchronisation&nbsp;: la synchronisation peut être coupée en un clic, en utilisant l&rsquo;option « convertir en bloc normal ». Son contenu est alors modifiable sans altérer les autres contenus utilisant le même bloc réutilisable</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lorsque l&rsquo;on utilise le menu de l&rsquo;éditeur (les trois points verticaux), il est possible de cliquer sur le menu «&nbsp;Gérer tous les blocs réutilisables&nbsp;». </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cela vous amènera sur une interface dédiée de l&rsquo;administration de WordPress permettant de gérer tous vos blocs réutilisables comme vous le feriez pour vos articles ou vos pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En outre, cette page de listing nous propose des boutons d&rsquo;import et d&rsquo;export de blocs réutilisables. Ainsi, vous pouvez carrément créer des blocs réutilisables sur un site puis les importer sur un autre.

En parallèle, j’ai très tôt réalisé des créations avec l’ordinateur.</p>\n<p>À partir de 2006, j’organisais des publications sur le design français depuis la Chine. J’utilisais les sites web pour centraliser mes projets. WordPress était déjà au cœur de ces activités. Peu à peu, il est devenu l’acteur dominant.</p>\n<h2>Q2 : Que devraient savoir les lecteurs sur tout ce que vous faites actuellement dans WordPress ?</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_35314\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 1600px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-35314\" src=\"https://kinsta.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/12/gregoirenoyelle-v7.png\" alt=\"Grégoire Noyelle\" width=\"1600\" height=\"840\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grégoire Noyelle</p></div>\n<p>Mon activité autour de WordPress est partagée depuis 2006 entre deux activités : les événements communautaires et les prestations professionnelles.</p>\n<p>Pour la première, nous organisons les <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/wordpress-ile-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meetups WordPress à Paris</a> avec l&rsquo;association <a href=\"https://wpparis.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WP Paris</a> que nous avons créée avec Mathieu Viet et Thierry Pigot. Toujours avec ces deux personnes, nous avons un podcast sur WordPress : <a href=\"https://veryfrenchtrip.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Very French Trip</a>. Enfin, je publie régulièrement des <a href=\"https://www.gregoirenoyelle.com/category/tuto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutoriels sur WordPress</a> sur des sujets plus ou moins techniques.</p>\n<p>Pour la deuxième, je partage mon temps entre la <a href=\"https://www.gregoirenoyelle.com/formations-wordpress-paris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">formation WordPress à Paris</a> dans mon centre de formation et dans les sociétés et la <a href=\"https://www.gregoirenoyelle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">réalisation de sites sur-mesure pour les entreprises</a>. Mon idée est de former les équipes pour qu’elles soient au maximum autonomes dans la mise en place et la maintenance de leur site.</p>\n<h2>Q3 : Quels défis avez-vous rencontrés dans la création de votre entreprise/vos projets ?</h2>\n<p>Au sein de mon activité, les défis majeurs concernent la partie formation. J’ai dû m’adapter aux différentes réformes qui deviennent, avec le temps, de plus en plus complexes pour les centres de formation à taille humaine. Pour essayer, pendant 2 ans, je n’ai fait que de la formation. Depuis, cette année, je tente de mixer la formation avec la mise en place de site WordPress sur-mesure pour mes clients.</p>\n<h2>Q4 : Quelque chose vous a-t-il surpris en entrant dans le monde de WordPress ?</h2>\n<p>Je fus très agréablement surpris par le côté chaleureux de la communauté. J’ai eu cette chance de connaître les WordCamps parisiens quand ils étaient encore très confidentiels. Cela a permis de nouer de solides liens avec la plupart des acteurs encore actifs aujourd’hui.</p>\n<p>J’aime aussi beaucoup comment le réseau des différents <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordCamps</a> a été constitué. Ce type d’évènement monopolise beaucoup d’énergie et WordCamp Central est là pour nous faciliter la tâche. Dans ce cadre, il m’est arrivé de rencontrer d’autres membres actifs de la communauté WordPress à l’étranger, et notamment en Asie où je me rends fréquemment. Ces expériences sont toujours très enrichissantes.</p>\n<h2>Q5 : À quoi ressemble l’avenir pour vous dans le monde de WordPress ?</h2>\n<p>Malgré mon enthousiasme initial, deux ans après, je suis plutôt perplexe sur la version actuelle de Gutenberg qui se veut être un constructeur de page sans en être vraiment un.</p>\n<p>Je suis en train de voir des solutions alternatives comme celle que propose <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> en mode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system?wprov=sfti1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Headless CMS</a>.</p>\n<h2>Q6 : Que recherchez-vous chez un hébergeur WordPress ?</h2>\n<p>De toute évidence, un bon hébergeur doit être rapide et avoir un excellent support.</p>\n<p>Pour moi, un autre aspect décisif est d’avoir de manière simple un environnement de préproduction afin de tester les mises à jour de l’environnement de production.</p>\n<h2>Q7 : Qu’est-ce que vous aimez faire lorsque vous êtes loin de votre ordinateur portable ?</h2>\n<p>J’aime passer du temps avec la famille et les amis. Sinon, je dessine, joue de la musique et je cuisine.</p>\n<p>Enfin, vivant dans une grande ville, le contact avec la nature est également primordial pour moi.</p>\n<h2>Q8 : Qui devrions-nous interviewer ensuite et pourquoi ?</h2>\n<p>Vous devriez interviewer <a href=\"https://imathi.eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mathieu Viet (@imath)</a> de ma part. Mathieu a développé de nombreuses extensions et c’est une personne vraiment passionnée par le projet WordPress et toujours de manière bénévole.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/interview-avec-gregoire-noyelle/\">Interview avec Grégoire Noyelle</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kinsta.com/fr\">Hébergement WordPress infogéré Kinsta</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wpfr/~4/QsFG1gGuqRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://kinsta.com/fr/blog/interview-avec-gregoire-noyelle/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:52:\"http://backend.userland.com/creativeCommonsRssModule\";a:1:{s:7:\"license\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/wpfr\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:2:{s:3:\"rel\";s:3:\"hub\";s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:4:\"info\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"uri\";s:4:\"wpfr\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:11:{s:12:\"content-type\";s:23:\"text/xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"etag\";s:27:\"E5CsPdok82zf46TQrpkPBlP3EJg\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 10:20:01 GMT\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 10:40:01 GMT\";s:7:\"expires\";s:29:\"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 10:40:01 GMT\";s:13:\"cache-control\";s:18:\"private, max-age=0\";s:22:\"x-content-type-options\";s:7:\"nosniff\";s:16:\"x-xss-protection\";s:13:\"1; mode=block\";s:6:\"server\";s:3:\"GSE\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:169:\"quic=\":443\"; ma=2592000; v=\"46,43\",h3-Q050=\":443\"; ma=2592000,h3-Q049=\":443\"; ma=2592000,h3-Q048=\":443\"; ma=2592000,h3-Q046=\":443\"; ma=2592000,h3-Q043=\":443\"; ma=2592000\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911040210\";}', 'no');

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié.

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié.

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.'),

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.'),

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié.

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.'),

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.'),

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.'),

Il n\'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s\'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n\'en soit modifié.
